Great job! Here is some feedback to help you improve:

The design of your website is excellent, especially the home page. However, some other pages, such as Event Creation and the page for specific events, could still use some polish. The Event Creation page is still very default, and the Event Details page can be polished significantly. For instance, there is a strange over-separation between the two columns. Also, I'd place the attendees on the right column instead, and put the content of the right column at the bottom, in a horizontal line (instead of a column). The "Attend" button also seems randomly placed. But I think you know this, and just didn't have time to finish the layout. This is why you got "Good" for Layout: Views.

<ins>Complexity and user benefit:</ins> this is a tough decision, because we must choose only between "Complex enough" and "Not complex enough", and I have decided to select the latter. Even though your website looks very good and the pages were designed in such a way that it flows very well, I feel like there is not enough benefit for the user at this stage (I still graded User Benefit as Excellent though, I just think you can do even better and provide more benefit, so as to improve your Complexity). Viewing the events and selecting "Attend" is nice, but could there also be some other functionalities that you could implement? Maybe a Q&A area in each event page, where interested participants could ask questions for the host to answer? And maybe also allow the host to select pre-determined categories for their events, and let the users filter for these categories (e.g., "Computer Science", "Arts", "Biology", etc). Is there anything else that you could add (instead or not) to make your webapp even more interesting?

But you are clearly on the right track and you should look at this as an opportunity to improve and push for maximum marks for the next phase, as you are clearly close to obtaining them.
